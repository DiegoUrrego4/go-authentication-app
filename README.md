# Authentication App

## Introduction - Project Brief

This project showcases a simple authentication app built using Go. It implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and follows the hexagonal architecture pattern, with a relational database connection and routing handled by Go’s native net/http package. The aim is to adhere to good coding practices while exploring different styles of implementation. The project includes branches featuring:

	•	Relational database connections
	•	Event-Driven Design
	•	Queues like RabbitMQ and/or Kafka
	•	Hexagonal architecture
	•	Middlewares
	•	Database migrations
	•	And much more…

The main branch has been left empty to avoid influencing your decision on which approach is best. That will depend on your project’s requirements, your understanding of the architecture, and your overall goals.
